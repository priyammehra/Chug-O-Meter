# Chug-O-Meter
descriptionChug-O-Meter is one of the most fun things that I have made till now. It requires the player to chug a glass of liquid, of any sort, within the time limit set by the opponent. If the player is able to chug the glass before the timer runs out than a fancy tone is played on the buzzer and emoticons are displayed on the 8*8 LED matrix. Similarly, if the player loses then harsh tones are played on the buzzer and sad emoticons are printed on the LED matrix. Components used: Arduino UNO, an 8*8 Led matrix, an FSR module, a 16*2 LCD, HC-05 Bluetooth module and a Buzzer.
